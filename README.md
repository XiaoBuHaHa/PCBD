# MBGD_Distillation_for-3D-Object-Detection
Data compression of LIDAR point clouds

Taking the 3D Object detector based on LIDAR point clouds as an example, the student model trained with 32/16 rays can achieve performance that approaches, or even surpasses, that of the teacher model trained with 64 rays.
